title: Slick 3.4.x is here!
author: Naftoli Gugenheim
---
Slick 3.4.0 was released and published to Maven Central, with 281 merged pull requests, many from the community. A pull request that could cause issues was then rolled back, so 3.4.1 was released as a hotfix.

The latest docs are at https://scala-slick.org/doc/stable/.


## How to upgrade

Upgrading should just be a matter of setting the version to `3.4.1` in your build files. (Or, give [Scala Interactive Update](https://github.com/kitlangton/scala-update) a try.)
However, see [the upgrade guide](https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-3-x-to-3-4-0) in case any changes do affect you.


## Whatâ€™s ahead

Now that 3.4.1 has been released, the top priority is Scala 3 support, G-d willing. There is already a proof of concept by Stefan Zeiger (the original author of Slick), but there is still work to be done to ready it for consumption.

After that is released, I would like to see Slick evolve freely. There are lots of possibilities. See below if you want to get involved.

Future releases might not be announced here. To get notified, go to https://github.com/slick/slick, click the Watch dropdown button at the top, select Custom, check Releases, and click Apply.


## Maintenance status

Slick is no longer led by Lightbend. It's entirely community-maintained.

I've used Slick for a long time and have written a few libraries for it, including https://github.com/nafg/slick-additions.

Around April 2021 I became Slick's primary maintainer. Slick had been relatively stagnant for a long time. My first priority was to make community-driven development viable. To that end, a ton of work has been done to automate project lifecycle processes (such as merging pull requests, updating documentation, and cutting releases). The less time those with merge rights need to spend on routine tasks, the less of a dependence the project has on them and the more the community is in control. Additionally this makes it easier for new maintainers to join, because they don't need to take on as much of a burden.

3.4.0 puts this model into practice, and I think that thank G-d it has proven successful. I hope that as a result releases will be more frequent in the future.
