## Report Bugs

Please use the [issue tracker](http://github.com/slick/slick/issues) at GitHub
to report bugs and issues.

## Hack on Slick

Getting started with working on the Slick codebase is easy. Clone the Slick git repository
from <http://github.com/slick/slick>. All you need is Java 8, git and
[sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). The Slick source code has all embedded
databases preconfigured for unit tests, so you can run a comprehensive test suite
without any further setup.

We always welcome 3rd-party pull requests for Slick. Note that you will have to sign the
[Lightbend Contributor License Agreement](https://www.lightbend.com/contribute/cla)
(takes two minutes on-line) before we can accept your contributions.

## Maintainers

Slick is community-maintained by a loose assortment of volunteers. Please help if you can.

[Lightbend](https://lightbend.com) provides the project with infrastructure and administrative oversight.

The [Community Process](/community/process) explains how decisions are made in the Slick project.
Please take note of the [Code of Conduct](https://www.lightbend.com/conduct) as well.
